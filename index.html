                            Hi everyone! My name is Qianyi Gong, but you can also call me Allen. 
                            I am an international exchange student from Shanghai, China.
                            I'm currently a junior student major in Computer Science and this is my first semester in UWM.

                            I'm particularly interested in data science and finance and hoping to build my career in this field.
                            Over the summer in China, I have joined a lab, doing some scientific research mainly focused on predicting 
                            the price and stock chart of exchange traded fund.
                            I think it is very interesting and I am willing to dig into this field further in my future study.

                            In my spare time, I'm a crazy soccer fan and I played for my university team in China in the league.
                            I also want to introduce my pet dog 'LL' to you.
                            She is a five-year-old Labrador retriever and she is very cute and clever.
