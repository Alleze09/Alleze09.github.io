                    The research introduces several novel methodologies, particularly in user behavior analysis, where we developed a Zombie user
                    identification system and comprehensive user profiling metrics.
                    Our analysis demonstrates that user behavioral patterns are the
                    most significant predictors of engagement success, followed by
                    temporal and content features. The study evaluated multiple
                    machine learning approaches, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks with Random Forest emerging as the
                    most effective model with a system named FRESH (Feature
                    Random Forest Explained by SHAP Hyperboost) we create
                    for choosing the best features, achieving a 31.51% accuracy
                    rate on our weighted evaluation metric the same implication in
                    Tianchi platform, ranking seventh among all participants in the engagement prediction challenge.

                    Explicit knowledge is essential for reasoning and understanding, offering interpretability and ease of transfer and editing.
                    In contrast, traditional parameter fine-tuning in neural networks lacks transparency and flexibility.
                    In this paper, we propose a novel framework for fine-tuning
                    language models using explicit knowledge. Unlike traditional fine-tuning that directly modifies model parameters,
                    our framework enhances the model's capabilities by externalizing its implicit knowledge, allowing for corrections and
                    adjustments on an explicit knowledge base. This knowledge
                    base can be independently validated, modified, and easily
                    transferred.</p>
